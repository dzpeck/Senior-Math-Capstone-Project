# Code corresponding to a model of a predator-prey system with prey fear of predator taken into account

This was done in the capstone project for my applied math degree. The goal of the capstone project was to demonstrate understanding of an academic paper while reproducing its results in code.
I was mainly in charge of programming the models. The programming is simple and does not offer much in the way of UI, but it does demonstrate some understanding of numpy and matplotlib.

If you are considering my employment:
I really enjoy the idea of working in scientific computing and am eager to learn more about it. I basically learned python from nothing for this project within the span of 3 months. I am a quick learner when it comes to syntax and rules, as demonstrated by much of my experience, including learning python, my musical training, and my formal language training.
I hope you would consider me as a powerful learner and eager participant in improvement!
